# Camaloon Bike Shop

This project was built as a technical test for a fullsatack position at Camaloon.
### Data modeling documentation
   To check all the datails about the hole process you can read the 
   [data modeling introduction](https://github.com/LeonardoGodoy/camaloon-bike-shop-api/blob/master/docs/data_modeling_introduction.md). There I described my entire approach and some datails about how I progressed. If you want the visual final version, you can access the [Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)]() as well.
