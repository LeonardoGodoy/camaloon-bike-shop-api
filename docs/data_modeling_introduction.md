# Data Modeling Introduction

### My approach to data modeling

After reading the problem description a couple of times, my first step is starting to extract facts I will have to deal with. To begin, I sketch the solution freely trying even possibilities I already am not so comfortable with. By doing it I have space and time with the situation to learn more about it and create expectations about an ideal solution. I get what looks to be the main points of complexity and focus on a better solution afterward.
The documents containing my ideas were split into two files, the first one [with my first ideas](https://github.com/LeonardoGodoy/camaloon-bike-shop-api/blob/master/docs/data_modeling_first_try.md) and the last one where you can find my [official model](https://github.com/LeonardoGodoy/camaloon-bike-shop-api/blob/master/docs/data_modeling_second_try.md).

### Documentation Purpose

In a normal context, I would document it similarly and bring my ideas to the team to discuss.
I would probably bring some concerns to my team orally.

I use this document type as a support to find a good solution. After implementation, an ERD would be much more useful. I found it a good way of showing my thoughts accordingly to your request.

"The global goal of this task is to understand your way of working/thinking..."
