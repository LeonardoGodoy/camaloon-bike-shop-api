# Data Modeling Introduction

### My approach to data modeling

After reading the problem description a cople of times, my first step is starting to extract facts I will have to deal with. To begin, I scrach the solution freely trying even possibilities I already am not so confortable with. Doing it I have space and time with the situation to learn more about it and create expectations about an ideal solution. I get what looks to be the main points of complexity and can foucus on a better solution afterwards.
The documents containing my ideias were splited in two files, the first one [with my first ideas](https://github.com/LeonardoGodoy/camaloon-bike-shop-api/docs/data_modeling_first_try.md) and the last one where you can find my [oficial model](https://github.com/LeonardoGodoy/camaloon-bike-shop-api/blob/master/docs/data_modeling_second_try.md).

### Documentation Purpose

In a normal context I would definitly document it in a similar way and bring my ideas to the team to discuss.
Some concerns I would probably bring to my team orally.

I use this files as a support to find a good solution and not exactlly as a documentation. I foud it a good way of showing my thoughts accordingly to your request.
